## equilateral triangle
base length, side length have the same value and internal angles are the same.
if you use the left-return (.lt), you use the external angle (180-60) of the input
Hence it is easy to use the for_range method to lop through 3 times to get the triangle.

## isosceles triangle
use the desired angle(θ) and base-length (b) to calculate the side-length (s) of the triangle.
 s = b / (2 * cos(θ))
